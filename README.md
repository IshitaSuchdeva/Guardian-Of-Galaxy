#Guardian of Galaxy: Asteroid Shooting Game

In the "Guardian of Galaxy", players take on the role of an alien tasked with defending their home planet from a relentless barrage of asteroids hurtling through space. Armed with a powerful laser beam, players
must skillfully blast these cosmic hazards.

Game Instructions:

Life Force: Players start with a life force of 100. Each collision with an asteroid decreases the life force by 10 points. When the life force reaches 0, the game ends.

Scoring: Players earn 1 point for each successful hit on an asteroid. 

Shooting and Movement: The alien can shoot with the mouse and move using the 'w', 'a', 's', 'd' keys respectively.

Increasing Difficulty: As the score increases in multiples of 10 and 3, the speed and rotation of the asteroids increase, making the game more challenging.

Level Progression: The game level advances with every multiple of 10 points scored.

Game Features:

Fast-Paced Action: The game provides an intense, fast-paced gaming experience with waves of asteroids increasing in speed and number.

Strategic Gameplay: Players must make quick, strategic decisions to survive and score points.

Challenging Reflexes: The game tests players' reflexes and precision as they navigate and shoot down the asteroids.

High Stakes: Every hit and miss escalates the stakes, pushing players to the limits of their abilities.

Will you emerge victorious and claim the title of the ultimate guardian of the galaxy? The fate of your alien homeland hangs in the balance.
